# robogenius
### About
This project includes code for RoboGenius, a TinyML-enabled robot (minitature vehicle) that moves based on spoken commands (eg. forward for 'go'),
and detects the digit formed by the path it traverses. The ipynbs include the code for training the respective ML models using TensorFlow,
and converting them to TensorFlow Lite and eventually TensorFlow Lite Micro for deployment on the Arduino. The remanining directories are
the codebases for both models to run the desired functionality on the Arduino attached to the robot/vehicle.
